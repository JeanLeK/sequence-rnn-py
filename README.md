# logsequence-rnn-py
This program analyze the los sequence using Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based on the python library [Keras](http://keras.io/).

It is based on [this](https://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/master/examples/lstm_text_generation.py) text generation exampe of Keras.

Two great materials about LSTM: [Understanding LSTM Networks](http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/) and [Understanding LSTM and its diagrams](https://medium.com/@shiyan/understanding-lstm-and-its-diagrams-37e2f46f1714#.5hkwmotmr)
