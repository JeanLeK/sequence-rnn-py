# sequence-rnn-py
This program analyze the sequence using Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based on the python library [Keras](http://keras.io/).
It is based on [this](https://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/master/examples/lstm_text_generation.py) text generation exampe of Keras.

## Requirements

- [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/): The fundamental package needed for scientific computing with Python.
- [Theano](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/): A Python library that allows you to define, optimize, and evaluate mathematical expressions involving multi-dimensional arrays efficiently.
- [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/): An open source software library for numerical computation using data flow graphs.
- [Keras](http://keras.io/): A minimalist, highly modular neural networks library, written in Python and capable of running on top of either TensorFlow or Theano.
