# logsequence-rnn-py
This program analyze the los sequence using Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based on the python library [Keras](http://keras.io/).
It is based on [this](https://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/master/examples/lstm_text_generation.py) text generation exampe of Keras.
