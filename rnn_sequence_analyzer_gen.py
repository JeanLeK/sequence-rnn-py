"""
This program analyze the integer sequence using Uni-diractional Recurrent Neural
Network (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)
based on the python library Keras.

Input data is Generator and the training is by calling model.fit_generator().

"Keras is a minimalist, highly modular neural networks library, written in
 Python and capable of running on top of either TensorFlow or Theano."
                                                ---- Keras (http://keras.io/)

It is based on this Keras example - lstm_text_generation:
